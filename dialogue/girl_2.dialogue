Young Girl: My [shake rate=10 level=3]brother[/shake], he's gone! *sobs uncontrollably*
Young Girl: He left without a trace. It's been days, and I can't find him - no matter how much I search! *weeps bitterly*
- How long ago did he run away?
	Young Girl: I can't recall exactly since he vanished. But it hasn't been very long.
	- What happened? Why did he suddenly disappear?
		=> girl_3_1
- Call the police, now

Young Girl: [shake rate=5 level=5]Dad[/shake] hit him. That's why he ran away.
- We need to contact the police
	Me: This isn't just a matter of escaping danger; it's about protecting you from your dad's violence.
	Me: Honey, I'll help you call the police. We need to find your brother first and then deal with this dad situation.
	Me: I need to ensure your and your brother's safety.

	Young Girl: No, don't call the police...please!!
	Young Girl: It was all my fault.
	Young Girl: I had told mom that brother snatched her money, but it was me.
	- Oh, so it's you, is it?
		Me: Why did you take something that doesn't belong to you?
		=> girl_3_5
- Why did your dad hit him?
	Young Girl: Mama was mad 'cause she believed its brother took her coins, and [shake rate=5 level=5]Papa[/shake] got real grouchy so...
	- He took mama's money?

Young Girl: No cops! It was all me! I'm begging you, don't call them! 
Young Girl: If they come, I'll be thrown in jail - No please! Don't do it!
Me: You won't get into trouble here; just tell me slowly.
Young Girl: It all begins with me â€” I'm the one who told mom he stole her money.
- Did your brother really take the money?
	=> girl_3_4
- So your mom got angry and kicked your brother out the house?
	Young Girl: [shake rate=20 level=5]Mom[/shake] was so angry she threw a punch at my brother, and he ran away in fear.
	- It's not your fault at all
		Young Girl: But it was actually...
		Young Girl: me.
		Young Girl: It's me. I took mama's coins.
		- Oh it's you.. Why did you do that, sweetie?

Young Girl: Because.. I wanted so desperately to get the pink hair ribbon, but my parents refused to buy it for me. 
Young Girl: Everywhere I looked, all the other girls had these beautiful gadgets that made them feel special. 
Young Girl: All I wanted was a simple hair ribbon, but why were my parents so adamant against it?
- It's lovely
	Me: Sounds like you enjoyed it a lot.
	Young Girl: Because it's so pretty.
	The young girl's voice is brighter, and she appears to have a great desire to keep discussing the ribbon.
	- The Lord will certainly forgive for such a stunning ribbon.

		Then, after remembering something else, she becomes quiet again.
		Young Girl: But my brother.. I am here for my brother!
		- Do you have any idea where your brother might have gone?
			=> girl_3_7
- Is that the pink ribbon you're wearing?
	=> girl_3_6
- That's not a reason to lie.
	Young Girl: I know I did wrong, but...

Young Girl: It's stunning, isn't it? This ribbon is the most exquisite one I've ever seen.
- Indeed
She appears to have a great desire to keep discussing the ribbon.
Me: It's indeed very pretty.
Me: It's truly lovely. Did your parents catch a glimpse of the ribbon?
Young Girl: Um, yeah...
Young Girl: [shake rate=20 level=10]They saw it.[/shake]
Young Girl: ..Did they?
Young Girl: Nah they didn't. Otherwise, [shake rate=10 level=5]dad[/shake] would have given me the same punishment he gave my brother.
Young Girl: I need to find him...as soon as possible!!
- Do you have any idea where your brother might have gone?

Young Girl: My brother is a fan of the Bakery.
Young Girl: He goes to the shop on sunny afternoons when he can afford time for leisure.
Young Girl: The bread was so fresh with buttery sweety smells.
That bakery is a local favorite; it's quite popular with the youngsters.
I couldn't help but be surprised by the strange coincidence of it all. 
It was near here, close to the church, a place I had visited many times before in my life.
Young Girl: Is the Bakery close to.. here?
- What is my brother's appearance?
	Young Girl: Chestnut-colored, curly hair... He was about my height. 
	Young Girl: Why do you ask that? Surely you saw him!
	- Yes, I saw him last night.
		Young Girl: [shake rate=10 level=5]Where is he?![/shake] Please, tell me now do not keep me in suspense. Hurry!
		Young Girl: If my brother doesn't come home soon, Mom and Dad will be incredibly worried!
		- Tell her
			Me: Don't worry, he's safe right now.
			=> girl_3_8
			
		- Don't tell her
			Me: Don't be panic; he's in a secure location. I will lead you to where he is later on.
			Young Girl: I know the effort would be overwhelming for you. 
			Young Girl: With every second ticking away, I need to bring him home before the sun sets and [shake rate=20 level=10]mom and dad[/shake] wont be driven into a frantic fear.
			- Okay, I will tell you
				=> girl_3_8
			- Are you in such a hurry?
				Me: Take it easy out there.
				Me: Or would you like me to tag along with you to the police station?
				
				=> girl_3_9
		- I will call the police for you

You scribble the address on a scrap of paper.
Young Girl: Much much appreciated!
Young Girl: I'll head over there and [shake rate=10 level=10]seek him out[/shake] now.
The young girl's voice trembles a bit. 
She's probably excited to find her brother soon.
You hear her jumping off the chair and running away.

Me: The police will help you.
Young Girl: [shake rate=20 level=10]NO, don't even try![/shake]
- ......
Young Girl: You're no help!, at all!
Young Girl: [shake rate=10 level=5]I have to..[/shake] I will figure it out by myself!
The young girl's voice trembles a bit.
Maybe she's too angry with me and feeling emotionally unstable.
You hear her jumping off the chair and running away.
- This is quite suspicious...
	Me: This girl speaks in a contradictory manner, raising suspicions.
	Me: That boy..
	Me: Is the boy I saved yesterday?
	Me: I need to call the police..
